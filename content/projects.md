  # PROJECTS 
</PageTitle>


I began my IT career in school, diving into shell scripting, sql injections and penetration testing, eventually evolving into full stack development and doing lance across the globe.

My paradigm combines technical expertise with business acumen. I did BBA alongside Python analytics to sharpen my programming and data scientist dream, building both full stack experience and extensive quantitative data expertise. This dual focus has been my goal from the very beginning. I code in layers and Python the elements, defining states, objects, and super positioning them in my free time.

 I bring together years of coding experience, business understanding, finances and global perspective to every project I undertake. My approach blends continuous learning with authentic engagement, creating meaningful website solutions while keeping things refreshingly real. Adding few many projects with direct flows. 

 rest i will write later.,
