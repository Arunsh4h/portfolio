  ### In-God-mode
</PageTitle>

I began my IT career in school, diving into shell scripting, sql injections and penetration testing, eventually evolving into full stack development and doing lance across the globe.

My paradigm combines technical expertise with business acumen. I did BBA alongside Python analytics to sharpen my programming and data scientist dream, building both full stack experience and extensive quantitative data expertise. This dual focus has been my goal from the very beginning. I code in layers and Python the elements, defining states, objects, and super positioning them in my free time.

As a person, sarcasm, playful fibs, and exploring are my instincts, each destination deepening my curiosity and reshaping my worldview,. My hobbies are coding, traveling, storytelling, history, culture and cuisine. I observe and hustle through all that defines me, 24/7 confident, ready to party or disappear into nature or a new city, someone who navigates complexity with both analytical brilliance and creative solutions. Basically a polymath who like depth, build depth, and dwell in it. From thought to emotion, I explore what's beneath the surface, always seeking the unseen layers of life. I approach problems with sharp wit and genuine enthusiasm, bringing serious skill wrapped in playful energy. I truly value my time and I also know exactly when to plot my escape and vanish mindfully if the vibe loses its grace. Just in case :P

 I bring together years of coding experience, business understanding, finances and global perspective to every project I undertake. My approach blends continuous learning with authentic engagement, creating meaningful website solutions while keeping things refreshingly real. Adding few many projects with direct flows. 

 rest i will write later.,
