  ### In-God-mode
</PageTitle>

I began my IT career in school, diving into shell scripting, sql injections and penetration testing, eventually evolving into full-stack development while freelancing across the globe.

My paradigm combines technical expertise with business acumen. I pursued a BBA alongside Python programming to sharpen my data scientist dream, building both full-stack experience and quantitative data expertise. This dual focus has been my goal from the very beginning.

As a person, sarcasm, playful fibs, and exploring are my instincts—each destination deepening my curiosity and reshaping my worldview. My hobbies are coding, traveling, storytelling, history, culture and cuisine. I observe and hustle through all that defines me. I'm 24/7 confident, ready to party or disappear into nature or a new city —someone who navigates complexity with both analytical brilliance and creative solutions. Been soccer captain since childhood, so I guess organizing chaos comes naturally. (soccer captain not football) I approach problems with sharp wit and genuine enthusiasm, bringing serious skill wrapped in playful energy. I truly value my time and I also know exactly when to plot my escape and vanish mindfully if the vibe loses its grace. Just in case :P

 I bring together years of coding experience, business understanding, finances and global perspective to every project I undertake. My approach blends continuous learning with authentic engagement, creating meaningful website22rb  solutions while keeping things refreshingly real.
